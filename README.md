## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am an experienced professional that has participated in a wide variety of
projects and worked with different technologies, mainly with Java for many years
and more recently with Python and Ruby on cloud environments.
I have great experience in product delivery by working on iterative processes,
developing parallel changes, breaking monolithic applications, improving the
operative by implementing solutions to face emergent work more efficiently. 
I consider myself an agile practitioner and have great experience working with
agile squads with best practices (scalable code, TDD, DDD) and within CI/CD
environments.
Always looking for growth and learn following best practices on
development, I have experience working remotely in distributed teams around
the world.
