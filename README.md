## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am an experienced professional that has participated in a wide variety of
projects and worked with different technologies, mainly with Java for many years
and more recently with Python and Ruby on cloud environments.
I have great experience in product delivery by working on iterative processes,
developing parallel changes, breaking monolithic applications, improving the
operative by implementing solutions to face emergent work more efficiently. 
I consider myself an agile practitioner, working with
agile squads following best practices (scalable code, TDD, DDD) and within CI/CD
environments.
Always looking for growth and learn, I have been working also remotely in distributed teams around
the world.
